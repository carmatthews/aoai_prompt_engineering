# Azure OpenAI Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is a concept in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves embedding descriptions of tasks in input to prompt an AI model to output the desired results.  A prompt typically includes the problem description, instructions on how to solve the problem,Â and examples of correct problem and solution pairs.

This notebook provides a few samples of prompts used to accomplish tasks like, text generation, summarization, and classification using the Azure OpenAI Service.
